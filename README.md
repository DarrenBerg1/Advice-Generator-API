What I learned
The biggest issue I had with this project was getting the javascript portion down.. With the getElementById and addEventListener. This is a portion of my learning that I really need to focus on, as well as the proper use and implementation of media queries.

I learned about the var() within CSS to use the colors that were provided, by copy and pasting them and then adding a var() when used.

the whole portion below this line, was something that I had to read up on and use chatGPT for as well.

/* Button Hover Styles / button:hover { filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0.75rem hsl(150, 100%,66%)); / Adding drop shadow effect on hover / transition: all 0.2s ease-out; / Adding smooth transition effect */ }

/* Media Query for Small Screens / @media screen and (max-width: 500px) { .advice-card { width: 350px; / Adjusting card width for small screens */ } }
